# Physics Computational Methods Case Study Square

[Simplified Chinese](README.md) | English

## Introduction

**Physics Computational Methods Case Study Square** is an online platform designed for educational and learning scenarios, focusing on displaying and running Jupyter Notebook files. We provide a convenient environment where teachers and students can upload their Jupyter Notebook assignments, categorize them, and make them easily accessible for others to browse and run.

## 💡 Features

- **Categorized Display**: We categorize Jupyter Notebook files by each assignment or project, making it easier to find and browse.
- **Run Online**: Users can run Jupyter Notebook files directly on our website without any configuration needed on their local environment.
- **Data Packaging**: Each Jupyter Notebook file can come with its required data for processing, making it convenient for uploading and downloading.
- **Isolated Running Environment**: We ensure that each Jupyter Notebook file runs in a relatively isolated location to ensure data security and stable operation.

## 📘 User Guide

1. **Upload Assignments**: Teachers or students can upload their Jupyter Notebook files and related data to the platform using our upload feature.
2. **Browse Assignments**: Users can browse all uploaded assignments on the homepage and can filter content they are interested in based on categories.
3. **Run Assignments**: Users can click on any assignment to enter the online running environment and directly run the Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠 Technical Details

- **Frontend**: We have constructed an intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.
- **Backend**: We handle user requests and manage data using the Flask framework.
- **Database**: We use SQLite to store metadata of the assignments.
- **Storage**: The server automatically pushes files to the GitHub or Gitee repository for storage.
- **Running Environment**: We provide an online running environment for Jupyter Notebooks using MyBinder.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

This project uses Docker for deployment. Please ensure that your server has Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1. Clone the repository to your server.
2. Modify the `app.py` file in the root directory, change the values of `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITEE_TOKEN` to the Token of your GitHub or Gitee repository, and change the values of `GITHUB_REPO` and `GITEE_REPO` to the address of your GitHub or Gitee repository.
3. Set the value of `GITHUB_OR_GITEE` to `github` or `gitee`, to specify using GitHub or Gitee as the repository. Gitee is recommended for use within China, as the transmission is more stable, avoiding the server's inability to connect to GitHub.
4. Run `docker-compose up --build` in the root directory of the project.
5. Visit `http://your-server-ip:1753`.
